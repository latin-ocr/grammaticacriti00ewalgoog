' P. 6. §- 10 et 11. De linguae, quae nunc in Arabiae
penetralibus inter Bedsuinos viget, ratione meliora et certiora
tandem nos edocuit J. L. Burckhardt, notes on the Be-
douins and Wahabys (London 1830) p. 211. Locum memo-
rabilem integrum describere placet: “The Bedouin 'dialect is
every where different from, the Arabio spoken in towns and
villageS, eve'n among these- tribes whose territories adjoin
the inhabited placeS, and who mix in frequent intercourse
with town’s-people. The Bedouins use a dialect much more
correct and grammatical- than the low language' of the Sy-
rian and Egyptian mob, who is wholly excluded from the
encampments of the Desert. There is, however, among the
Bedouins themselves, a great variety of dialects3 — but they
all agree in pronouncing each letter with much precision,
expressing its exact force or power, which, with respect to

the· letters ὥ 5> ub lh, is never the case among the inhabi-
tants of townS. The Bedouins agree also universally in
using, as common, many select words, which in the towns
would be‘ called ‘literal terms' (ἒξ-,ξ ’ (ω’) and in speaking
always with grammatical accuracy. -- Ι shall here venture

to affirm, that by far the best Arabic is spoken in the De-
sert, and that Bedouins are as much distinguished. from

others Arabs, by the purity of their language, as they are

by that os their manners. That they have preserved, during ¹

so many centuries, the 'purity of their language, without
books or writings, may with probability to be ascribed to

the frequent practise of learning by heart and reciting poe-
try. Young persons are thus accustomed to the use of select

and elegant expressions3 and there are always in the camps
some old men who take delight ιη explaining the recondite
meanings and other difficulties that may occur in the poems.”
